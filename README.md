dark.py may not work for python3.9 or python 3.10.2 or python 3 it really works for python 2
i made it for Education PURPOSES ONLY!
i am currently making another dark.py
that works for python 3 and python3.9
idk about python 3.10.2
i might release dark.py but in beta mode
Password cracker.py works for all versions
as long as you do pip3 install pyautogui
or pip install pyautogui or
pip3.9 install pyautogui
